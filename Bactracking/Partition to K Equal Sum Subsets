if a newbie(others plz skip this) asks why comparison between code is neededðŸ˜…?
Understanding the different style of code and recurrence is helpful that's why I tried to figure out the difference between standard solution(like from gfg,which I was seeing approx from last 2 years when I was not good at recursion and today when I am developed with style thinking or approach of problem solving how it is different from standard approach, this habit helped me to see my thought process)

Explanation
a -> [0,1,2........n-1] (n - elements)

sum -> [0,1,2,...k-1] (k - sets)

My notion of code implementation is similar and different from gfg standard code (however final working is same only difference is how reccurence is being governed)

Base case
-> all the elements are exausted or not (mycode)
-> whether k-1 sets out of k sets are filled or not (gfg code)

note: in gfg code they are perfoming recurrence if k-1 sets are not filled ie when a particular set is filled they procced to fill the next set

Recursive case: case for exploring all possiblites - (this portion of mycode is similar to gfg code)

-> for each element a[i](for all n-elements) check all k-sets(loosely speaking) in which we can fit a[i]

        // bcz in gfg standard code there base case is depending whether all the k-sets are filled up(exhausted) or not
